Hi there, I'm Nikhil Nair, currently a first-year student pursuing Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) with heightened focus on AI. What truly drives my academic pursuit of excellence is my sheer interest in programming and the idea of developing minimalistic solutions to address seemigly complex problems head-on. Other than programming, my hobbies include playing chess, table tennis and reading action novels. I love learning new stuff for seemingly no reason as i find them to be challenging.
